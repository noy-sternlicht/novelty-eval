"""
Shared figure logic
===================
What every figure entry point — the notebooks and the remaining scripts — has to
agree on: where a merge's saved chart data lives, which cells are artefacts and
must be blanked, how the same ablation is recognised across differently-named
tracks, and the delta palette.

This module holds the things that would silently drift apart if each entry
point kept its own copy, so a figure regenerated from a notebook and one
regenerated from a script cannot disagree about the numbers they may show.

`TwoTrackFigure` at the bottom is the one full figure that lives here rather
than with its caller: two notebooks draw it over different experiments, so the
drawing is shared and only the wording is theirs.

@dataclass
class TwoTrackFigure:
    """
    One two-track ablation figure: what it says, and how it is drawn.

    Everything that differs between experiments is a field, so nothing in the
    drawing knows which one it is drawing. `table` is the whole data path — one
    tidy row per (track, ablation, judge), everything already in points — and
    the two draw methods are two readings of that table: `draw` colours the
    change an ablation made, `draw_absolute` the score it landed on. Same
    layout either way, so the pair can be read side by side.

    tracks: (block title, merge dir under output/ablation_sweeps, name token),
        left to right. The token fills {track} in a row name.
    rows: (panel name, row label), top to bottom, with an optional third
        element naming the setups the row belongs to — an ablation only one
        setup was run for is left out of the other rather than drawn as a row
        of dashes. {setup} and {track} expand in the panel name, for ablations
        whose instance set differs per track or per setup.
    metrics: the metric to read per setup — the two setups score different
        things. It lands in the filename, never on the figure, so the caption
        has to say which it is.
    row_groups: (group label, panel names in it) — a bracket in the left margin
        naming what its rows have in common. Named by panel name rather than by
        position, so a setup that draws only some of a group's rows brackets
        what it actually drew; a group whose rows are not drawn together is a
        mistake in the figure, not something to draw around, so it raises. A
        group label of "" draws the bracket unnamed, for a group too short to
        set the name beside.
